![[Thiramen Hero Forge.png]]Hitze was born to a tinkerer and his wife in the small village of [[Drowel]]. Its near an ever-changing forest that was said to contain the sweetest fruit in the entire continent - the Sweet-Sweet Fruit. Hitze picked up on his father's tinkering skills and used his passion for swordplay to hone his combat abilities as he grew up.

With dreams of becoming an adventurer, the young Hitze often ventured into the nearby forest to find the elusive Sweet-Sweet Fruit. He met a young elf in the forest with whom he went on countless forest expeditions. Along the way, they taught one another some simple words in their native tongues. Hitze, not being the brightest child, only picked up on a few easy words in Elven - however, one word, thiramen, stood out to him. The elf seemed to call Hitze this word often as they grew closer.

A year into their expeditions, the two came across a mystical tree with just one strange looking fruit growing on a high branch. Hitze climbed up and grabbed the fruit. The duo determined that this must be the treasure they were searching for - the Sweet-Sweet Fruit! Hitze handed the fruit to the elf, thanking her for being his partner on their adventures.

Just a day later, a fire started and began to ravage the village, quickly spreading into the nearby forest as well. Hitze worked tirelessly to stop the fire and save anyone trapped in engulfed buildings. Once the flames subsided the next day, Hitze searched the forest for the elf with no success. Longing to be reunited with his childhood companion, Hitze set out from the village on his 18th birthday to explore the lands of [[Guilder]] under a new name - Thiramen.

Soon after beginning his quest, he lands in the town of [[Penshurst]]. There he joins [[The Circus Troupe]] and sets out on bigger adventures.
