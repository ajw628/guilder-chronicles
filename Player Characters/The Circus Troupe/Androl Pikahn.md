Born to the [[High Families|Tallin]] family, vassal of the king, and the youngest of 10 children, Cadmus was always looked down on. He received the same training as his siblings did, but was never thought of seriously. Everyone knew that his eldest brother Pollux would claim his fathers seat and his second eldest brother Dion would likely become an advisor to the king. His eldest sister, Eleonora, would likely by married off to some poor lord, she would rule him, and his second eldest sister, Jane, was on track to leading the weaving and stonemason guilds. 

The rest of his sibling were on track to lead armies or marry/join the church. Cadmus wanted no such thing. When he wasn't training with his siblings and the local sword master, he spent his time hidden away in the library. One day he tried to pull out a book and it wouldn't come out. He pulled harder, only to hear a click as the bookshelf slid open in front of him. He watched as in front of him appeared a path, covered in cobwebs and smelling of damp, and being the curious scholar he was, decided to go adventuring. 

He walked for what he thought was hours and stumbled into a room with four lit braziers surrounding a pedestal. On the pedestal, there lay an old, weather-beaten tome wrapped in stitched together leather. What looked like an ear could be seen on the spine. He heard a whispering which grew louder as he approached. "Free me and I will give you what you desire". He opened the book and fell to his knees. The agonizing pain he felt in his chest and head could only be described as having someone carve something onto his heart and brain. 

He came to as the local medicine woman lifted a cool cloth from his head. He had been found screaming in pain in the library and was taken to get help. After determining that he was physically well, he was released and sent back to the castle. That night, as he lay in his room, he felt a power grow in him. Something new. He watched as his skin began to glow with a violet light and felt as it started to burn. He began to panic as the pain increased. He felt a point at which he could release the power within him. As he did, a ball of dark energy exploded out..

Wanting to separate himself from his family and explore his powers, he created the name Androl Pikahn, named after one of his heroes [[Pekahn Muffin]].
