![[Relador Hero Forge.png]]Competion. That was life. Raised with 3 brothers in the [[Aklar|captital]], Relador was never the oldest, fastest, or strongest. During the annual gauntlet, he could never get first. One of his brothers was always better. On joining the Guilderian army, he strove to be the best. The strongest soldiers ended up the best, and the harder the fight, the more fun he had. He grew to be the scourge of his unit, driven by his desire for strength. He left the army when he felt they held back his desire to grow. He could not stay still when he knew there were stronger foes to fight and more situations in which he could test his power.

His quest for strength led him south through the city of [[Vakdel]] and to [[Penshurst]]. He met [[Thiramen]] and [[Elyria Tannis|Elyria]] while questing for money. He then joined them forming the [[The Circus Troupe]].

While helping out the Adventurer's Guild in [[Greendale]], Relador had an accident with a mandrake plant. After recieving what should be a lethal exposure of screams, he was rushed to the university in [[Greendale]] where the party hoped someone could find his care. With out the the party's knowledge, Relador was taken away to another location, presumably to be healed.
