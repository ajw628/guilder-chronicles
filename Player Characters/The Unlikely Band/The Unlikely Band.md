Like the title suggests, the members of this adventuring party were not the most likely traveling companions, but their encounters brought them together. It all started in 326 RC in the town of [[Penshurst]]. Rosalie Margrave, an elderly member of the community, had a family heirloom stolen by a nearby goblin camp. [[Relador]] the paladin, [[Thiramen]] the fighter, and [[Elyria Tannis|Elyria]] the cleric take up the quest. A harrowing fight reveals the amulet. They return their find and enter to find a hooded figure, [[Ashlan]] the rogue, the fourth member of their party.
