![[Elyria Hero Forge.png]]
Being born as a half-elf, Elyria was fated to age more quickly than her elven peers yet slower than her human counterparts. Growing up in the slums of [[Vakdel]]‌, a destitute environment led Elyria to become acquainted with people primarily motivated by primal reactions such as fear and greed. With an ethnicity that made her feel outcast and an environment that gave her nothing but the cold ground beneath her feet, Elyria struggled to find a constant in a world of chaos.

Perhaps by the luck of the gods or some cosmic alignment, Elyria had a chance encounter with an elder white male named Clancy. Despite her shortage of faith in the world and learned lack of trust, Elyria would come to develop strong morals and sense of self from spending the remainder of her days in the slums with Clancy.

With a commitment to nothing but the will to survive, Elyria was drawn to Clancy’s unwavering sense of right and wrong amidst the chaos of the slums. His steeled devotion appeared to Elyria as a way out of the murky qualities of a corrupt and indifferent world. Clancy would teach Elyria that while this world does not play fair and favors not even those that strive to do right, there is great importance in maintaining a balance in society. For without a sense of order in oneself, there is not hope of redemption and renewal.

Clancy’s lessons would lead Elyria to adopt the profession of Cleric belonging to the Order Domain in an effort to not forget his guidance. Despite the ruthlessness she experienced at the hands of those down on their luck, Elyria would turn to Clancy’s teachings to use as a lens on those in her path. Recognizing that her opposition may have motivations that in Elyria’s own eyes can be rationalized and understood leads her divine power to be on that of a scale. The stronger her moral lack-of-alignment with her adversary, the greater her retribution against them, but the more she aligns with her adversary’s actions, the less she is able to take up arms against them, especially in the name of a god.

Starting her adventure she wanders south the the town of [[Penshurst]]. There she finds [[Thiramen]] and [[Relador]] who form [[The Unlikely Band]].
