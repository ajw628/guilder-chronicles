Roguish Archetype (Subclass)

To the outside world, your character appears as a normal everyday medium sized race, but unbeknownst to them, you are actually two goblins in a trench coat! The original adventurer was tragically slain early into their escapades, but luckily for two goblins looking for adventure, a spot needed to filled! The character loses any racial bonuses from the prior adventurer’s race before taking the subclass and gains those of the goblin race. 

Practiced Disguise
Gain proficiency in a disguise kit and advantage on ability checks when maintaining a disguise.

Split!
At 3rd level, you can use your reaction to split into the two goblins when you hit with an attack or grapple. Grapples only affect the lower goblin, damage is negated unless it is an area of effect, in which case the damage is halved. Each goblin gets half of the character’s current health points and they can immediately take the disengage action for free and move up to their maximum movement speed. The upper goblin retains all of the character’s gear and armor. The lower goblin is given a knife. Both goblins can move the full movement speed of the character. You can use your action or bonus action to control either goblin. Once in melee range, the pair can reform into the original character, summing their health points to make the characters renewed health points. Death saving throws are not made until both goblins are downed. This ability can be used once per short rest. 

Two for the Price of One (Maybe)
Whenever you like, you can separate the two goblins using a bonus action. The two goblins are split and controlled like they are in the “Split!” ability.

Two Minds are Greater than One
At 9th level, you gain advantage on sleight of hand checks when thieving. You also gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. 

Surprise!
At 13th level, “Split!“ causes the creature who caused the split to roll at disadvantage until the end of their next turn. 

Practice Makes Perfect
Starting at 17th level, you can take 2 actions in one turn, split or not, once per long rest.
