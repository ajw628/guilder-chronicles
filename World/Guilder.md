Guilder is the first Human country on the continent. Humans first settled on the continent around 250 years before the founding of Guilder. It was first formed as a collaboration of multiple larger cities that were established on the continent. [[Aklar]] was deemed to be the capital due to its strategic location and fortitude. Guilder is expanding every year as it explores the wilds of the continent. Dwarves for the most part have joined with the country, but the elves decided to remain separate and hidden from the humans.
