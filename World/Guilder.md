Guilder is the first Human country on the new continent. Humans first settled on the continent around 250 years before the founding of Guilder. It was first formed as a collaboration of many of the [[High Families]]. The Wright family was chosen to be the head and became the leading family. This formed the Guilderian Kingdom led by its monarchy and the High Five. [[Aklar]] was deemed to be the capital due to its strategic location and fortitude. The Kingdom is constantly expandign every year as it explores the wilds of the continent. Dwarves for the most part have joined with the country, but the elves decided to remain separate and hidden from the humans.
