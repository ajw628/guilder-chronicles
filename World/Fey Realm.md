The Fey Realm is a plane of existence that mirrors [[Eyslin]]. Many magical creatures and monsters originate from this plane. It is a plane of wonder and intrigue. It is often dangerous for [[Terrans]] to explore the Fey Realm as it is  fundamentally different from terran plane. Most terrans also do not have a large grasp on the power of magic. Magic that is not bestowed by a holy figure has its origins in the fey realm, leading to most things in the realm to be naturally magical. 

Before the expansion of elves across [[Eyslin]], the fey realm used to have a greater entanglement with the terran realm. The great archfeys of the realm shrank the interactions of the two realms to protect the sanctity of the fey realm. Eventually a sect of the elves accepted the fey ways and gained their magic. The elves have since become an integral part of the fey realm long with the gnomes. They are the only two creatures who still travel between the two realms. In modern times there only exist four gateways between the two realms. Each gateway is guarded by a group of druids who work to hide its existence from  terrans.
