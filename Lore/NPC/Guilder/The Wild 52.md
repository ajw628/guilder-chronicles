Also known as “The 52”, they are a playing card themed gang that operate out of [[San Faldo]]. Their leader, Bart Cleavon aka “Right Bauer”, is a member of the city council for Cardview. Cardview is largely controlled and patrolled by the members of the 52.

The 52 is divided into four groups known as the suits. The suits are lead by the ace of each suit. The organization is led by the left and right Bauers. Many of the members dawn leather jackets that have playing cards in their breast pocket. Jackets are traded and earned as someone enters the organization.

There is a bar located in the Cardview district of San Faldo called the Left Bauer. The bar is only a front for what is actually the headquarters of the group. Answering the bartender’s riddle will give you entrance to the basement. There is a fighting ring in the basement where people can vie for the honor of earning a card. Wagers are commonplace and the Bauers are often seen there. 

Entrance Riddle:
I'm around kings and queens
I rule the round table
I hold countless numbers
With money and fable
I trick some deviously
But bring prosperity to a few
If you're feeling lucky
Try me, I might surprise you

Session Notes:
5 of Diamonds is in the ring looking for competitors. Cards can get extra pay and possibly promotions by fighting in the ring. A fight finishes up when they enter. The 10 of clubs almost kills what appears to be a normal citizen. The bauers room will have shadowed figures in it 

Hibou’s shop will have the kid running it with a table set up. A couple potions can be bought at the table. They wont answer any questions about their true identity. Healing potion. Shrinking potion. Featherfalling potion. 

News of monster attacks in Logetown. Normal ferry there temporarily halted for passengers. There is a fishing crew which will take them if they want passage. 20 gold, trade, or services. Maybe taking something that the 52 took from the fishers
