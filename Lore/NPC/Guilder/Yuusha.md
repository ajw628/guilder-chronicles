Yuusha is a lost knight from the days of old. Little is known about him to the people of [[Guilder]] since he fought hundreds of years before its founding. A paladin who worshiped [[Titans|Silvanus]], he became very powerful with his years of adventuring. The ruling family of the area, a predecessor to the [[High Families|Tallin]] family, felt threatened by his strength. They convened with strong spirits to seal him away, in a realm between the terran and the fey. Here Yuusha has been able to gain his own power in hopes to pass it on, though this has left him as nothing but a husk of his former self. Since then, he has been trapped unable to pass on, looking for someone to come to his aid. 

Hundreds of years later, around the year 320RC, [[Androl Pikahn|Cadmus Tallin]] unknowingly discovered a portion of Yuushaâ€™s seal, empowering him with some of the knights power. Yuusha now hopes to train Cadmus and have him take up the old knights mantle.
