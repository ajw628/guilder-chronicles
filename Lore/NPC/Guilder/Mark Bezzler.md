Mark Bezzler is a con man and a merchant. He travels all over [[Guilder]] in search of rare and special artifacts. Although not always popular with those he meets, he can sell you some of the most incredible artifacts of the land. 

He dons many disguises when he sets up shop to hide his identity from those he may have wronged in the past.
