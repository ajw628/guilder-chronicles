Yuusha is a lost knight from the days of old. Little is known about him to the people of [[Guilder]] since he fought hundreds of years before its founding. A paladin who worshiped [[Titans|Silvanus]], he became very powerful with his years of adventuring. The ruling family of the area, a predecessor to the [[High Families|Tallin]] family, felt threatened by his strength. They convened with strong spirits to seal him away, in a realm between the terran and the fey. Here Yuusha has been able to gain his own power through is want for revenge, though this has left him as nothing but a husk of his former self. Since then, he has been trapped unable to pass on, looking for someone to come to his aid.
