Castien is a powerful and ancient elf. In his long life, he has gained many followers and some extreme ideals. Missing the days or yore, Castien longs to return to the terran realm with his followers. This plan is stopped by the druids and the archfeys who do not wish to reveal the [[Fey Realm]] to the humans of [[Guilder]]. Secretly aided by [[Mirricim]], Castien plans to invade the human realm, starting with the southern most entrance and [[Zuidel Isles]].
