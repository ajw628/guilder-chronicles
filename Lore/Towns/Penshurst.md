Penshurst is a quaint farming town south of the metropolis [[Vakdel]]. Its small population settled on either side of the [[Gochi River]]. The town was founded and is led by its castle which was originally built before the founding of [[Guilder]]. The town is mostly defined by its crossroads to the south, its castle, and the building for the Funky F. Melody Jazz club.
