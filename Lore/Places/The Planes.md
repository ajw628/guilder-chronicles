Well before even the origins of the elven council or even the [[Titans]], everything resided together on one great plane. For reasons unknown, a great rift occurred, fracturing the great plane into the [[Fey Realm]] and the [[Eyslin|Terran]] realm. The now disparate planes were taking shape as they are widely known. The magic of the universe stayed solely within the Fey realm, leaving the Terran realm desolate in that sense. 

Six mortals of the Terran realm were upset over their lack of magical access. They worked together to draw so much magical energy that they became incredibly powerful beings. This process of theirs wreaked havoc on the Terran realm. Portals between the Terran and Fey realms were created and many magical beings like spirits and demons came to roam the world. The once bitter mortals became more powerful than they could ever imagine. They became what are known as the Titans. Embarrassed by the chaos of their ritual, the Titans formed the outer planes which orbit the Terran and Fey realms.
