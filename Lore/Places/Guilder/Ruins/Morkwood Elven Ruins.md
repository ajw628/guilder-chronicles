These ruins were first discovered by the [[St. Patrick's Party]] after being led there by an orc camp. There were talented scientists and magicians that once lived in these ruins. An ancient form of the  elvish language covers some of the walls. The most notable discovery at the ruins was the [[Deck of Many Things]].
