The Fey Realm is a plane of existence that mirrors [[Terran Realm]]. Many magical creatures and monsters originate from this plane. It is a plane of wonder and intrigue. It is often dangerous for [[Terran Realm|Terrans]] to explore the Fey Realm as it is fundamentally different from terran plane. Eventually a sect of the elves accepted the fey ways and gained their magic. The elves have since become an integral part of the fey realm along with the gnomes. They are the only two species who often travel between the two realms. In modern times there only exist four gateways between the two realms. Each gateway is guarded by a group of druids who work to hide its existence from terrans.
