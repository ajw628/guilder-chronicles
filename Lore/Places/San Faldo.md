The entertainment capital in the south of [[Guilder]]. It is on the southern shore of the kingdom, situated on Zuidel Lagoon. The city handles all of the transportation and shipping for the [[Zuidel Isles]]. The area happens to have the highest concentration of fey adjacent creatures in the kingdom. The city is known for its extravagance and beauty. The city is lit up by colorful magical artifacts. Large Banners of three rotating water droplets of blue and gold line the streets as the flag of San Faldo. 

Although it was originally a shipping harbor for the kingdom, its beautiful weather and location attracted many tourists to its shores. The town now has many resorts, casinos, and entertainment districts. This change in the city has brought along vast wealth for the city and its leaders. 

San Faldo as a city has existed long before [[Guilder]] grew to power. There are still remnants of the old government in the form of the council, which governs the city. The council is made up of the mayor and a representative from six of the cities seven neighborhoods. The head of the council is mayor Rahm Johnson. The only neighborhood not represented is New San Faldo, which is the center for the new government brought by Guilder. 

One of the largest attractions of the city is its carnival: Clearie’s Carousel. Its weekly operations always draw large crowds. The city is also known for its casinos such as the Chips and Pearls.
