The manor is located in the [[Greenwood|forest]] of the same name. At one point in the far past, it was a lavish manor for elves of the area to gather and indulge. It was abandoned shortly after humans started settling in the area. [[Comet]] the pixie was the first inhabitant of the manor after the elves. The magic from the fey creatures in her party and of the forest kept the walls strong and hidden from people of [[Guilder]].
