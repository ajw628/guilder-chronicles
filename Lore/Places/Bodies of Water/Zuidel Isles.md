A group of four islands to the south of [[Guilder]]. They make a lagoon protecting the city of [[San Faldo]].

The four Isles are Een, Twee, Drie, and Vier. Only Vier does not have a human settlement on it. Because of the warm climate, it is good for farming many plants that cannot be grown on the main continent. The luxuries from these isles are a contributing factor as to why [[San Faldo]] is known as the entertainment capital. The wealth of the region has unfortunately attracted crime in the lagoon. Piracy is not an uncommon sight. The boats that run between Een, Twee, Drie, and San Faldo need to have protection. There are also myths of some magical creatures that prowl in the lagoon.
